# Overview
This dashboard explores global trends in measles vaccine coverage (MCV1) and under-five child mortality between 2000 and 2023. It highlights how expanded immunization—especially in low-income settings—has driven substantial improvements in child survival.

The dashboard visualizes [View the Dashboard](https://mascogit.github.io/final_project/):

-Changes in MCV1 coverage and child mortality over time

-Country-level and income-group comparisons

-The correlation between vaccination rates and mortality decline

-Top and bottom performers in child health outcomes

# Structure
-Welcome Page: Poster-style image and introduction

-Home Tab: Key insights and interactive graphs

-Progress Tabs: Value boxes, scatter plots, maps, and trend lines

-Comparative Views: Income group disparities and box plots

-Data Description: Methodology and download of cleaned dataset

# Data Sources
Data is sourced from Gapminder and includes:

-MCV1 (Measles-Containing Vaccine) coverage (% of 1-year-olds)
